# SmartPointerComparison
A comparison of Rust and C++ smart pointer implementations

This repository showcases the differences in language features, syntax, and libraries available in both Rust and C++, and how they affect the implementation of smart pointers. 
It explores the trade-offs and trade-ins between Rust and C++, including their different approaches to memory safety, performance, and ease of use, and provides a deeper understanding of smart pointers and memory management in both languages.
